# How we built it

**cARe Bot** was build based on voice user interface principles. Through Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Natural Language Understanding, Speech to Text and Text to Speech techniques, we created 3D interactive artificial human with Amazon Sumerian, Lex and Polly! 

**Website** cARe can be accessed through our website, which presents a responsive, dynamic and mobile friendly UI. The website will also display the latest news and directives about COVID-19 thanks to the interaction with web APIs.
React and CSS were used to implement the UI using code organised in small and isolated files which can interact with each other. cAre assistant has been integrated to the website using AWS and amazon Amplify.

# Objectives achieved.

- Made React website that integrates several APIs.
- Made Amazon Sumerian interaction that is complemented with Amazon Lex.
- The user can speak with our AR chatbot with a little few phrases.
